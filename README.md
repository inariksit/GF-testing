# gftest

The development of this tool has moved into
https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF/tree/master/src/tools/gftest

The papers we have written about this project are still in `doc/`, and
the grammars we used to test them are in `data/`.

(If someone *really* needs the old code, it's in the branch `old`.)
