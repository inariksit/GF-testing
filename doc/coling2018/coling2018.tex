\section{The problem}

Traditionally, GF grammars are tested by the grammarians themselves,
much like unit testing. When implementing some feature, such as 
relative clauses, the grammarian comes up with a test suite of 
sentences that include relative clauses, and stores in the form of 
abstract syntax trees. In principle, a test suite created for one 
language can easily be reused for another, because the ASTs are 
identical. Ideally, every time someone touches relative clauses 
in the any concrete syntax, the trees in the test suite will be 
linearised with the changed concrete syntax, and verified by someone
who speaks the language (or compared to the original gold standard, 
if there is one). This scheme can fail for various reasons: 

\begin{itemize}
\item The original list is not exhaustive: for instance, it tests only
``X, who loves me'' but not ``X, whom I love''. 
\item The original list is exhaustive in one language, but not in all:
for instance, it started in English and only included one noun, but in
French it would need at least one masculine and one feminine noun. 
\item The list is overly long, with redundant test cases, and human
testers are not motivated to read through. 
\item A grammarian makes a change somewhere else in the grammar, and
does not realize that it affects relative clauses, and thus does not
rerun the appropriate test suite. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Experiences as a grammar writer}


GF resource grammars include basic morphology and syntax of a language. GF morphology and lexicon can often be extracted fully or partly from data or existing morphological lexica, but the development of syntactic functions requires intensive human labour, and advanced knowledge on both linguistics and programming.
Many GF resource grammars are written by non-native speakers, relying on a grammar book and possibly a native informant.

%To make the problem more concrete, here is a set of problems, all found in real GF resource grammars.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Prepositions should merge with a single determiner, e.g. \emph{with~this} $\rightarrow$ \emph{thiswith}, but stay independent when the determiner quantifies a noun, e.g. \emph{with this house}.
%\item Word order 
%\end{itemize}
%Concrete problems: the kind of bugs we set out to find
%* Empty categories
%* Empty fields
%* Eliminated arguments

%Pick ~3 bugs: 
%what tree was generated? why? likelihood of finding this bug without our method.

  \caption{GF grammar for noun phrases}
\label{fig:exampleGrammar}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:exampleGrammar} shows a small example of a GF
grammar. The grammar generates noun phrases for a lexicon of eight words (\emph{house, hill, \dots, without}) in four lexical categories, and five functions to construct phrases. 
\t{CN} stands for common noun, and it can be modified by arbitrarily many adjectives (\t{Adj}), e.g. \emph{good small house}. A \t{CN} is quantified into a noun phrase (\t{NP}) by adding a determiner (\t{Det}); alternatively, a \t{Det} can also become an independent noun phrase. Finally, we can form an adverb (\t{Adv}) by combining a preposition (\t{Prep}) with an \t{NP}, and those adverbs can modify yet another \t{NP}.
We refer to this grammar throughout the paper.

\subsection{How it works}

\paragraph{Test cases} 
The basic unit of a test case is a single constructor, and the first step 
is to build a set of trees using that constructor.
If we are interested in a single lexical item, such as \emph{small}, 
then the subtree \t{small} is the full set of trees. If we choose a function 
with arguments, such as \t{PrepNP}, then we do the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item For each argument type (\t{Prep} and \t{NP}), compute the
  set of minimal and representative trees. This is a recursive
  process: to compute the set of trees in \t{NP}, we must consider
  all functions that create its argument types (\t{Det} and \t{CN}), until we
  have a set of lexical functions to choose from. 
\item Take a cross product, prune out redundant combinations, and apply the constructor \t{PrepNP} to the resulting set of arguments. The pruning method will be described later.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Test cases using \t{AdjCN}} Let us test the function
\t{AdjCN : Adj $\rightarrow$ CN $\rightarrow$ CN}, and take a Spanish concrete syntax as an example.
Firstly, we need a minimal and representative set of arguments of types
\t{Adj} and \t{CN}. Consider the nouns first: Spanish has a grammatical gender, so in order to be representative, we need an example of both masculine and feminine. Out of the small lexicon, \t{house} (\emph{casa}) is feminine, and \t{hill} (\emph{cerro}) is masculine, so we return those two nouns as the full set of argument trees in \t{CN}.

Secondly, we consider the adjectives. Most commonly, adjectives follow the noun, e.g. \emph{casa peque\~{n}a} `small house', 
but some adjectives precede the noun, e.g. \emph{buena casa} `good house'. Thus
in order to cover the full spectrum of adjective placement, we need one premodifier and one postmodifier adjective. We pick the words \t{good} and \t{small} as the arguments of type \t{Adj}.

Now, our full set of test cases are \t{AdjCN} applied to the cross product of \{\stackanchor{\tt \small good}{\tt \small small}\} $\times$ \{ \stackanchor{\tt \small house}{\tt \small hill}\}. 
Note that \t{CN} is unspecified for number, because it is still waiting for a
determiner (e.g. \t{this} or \t{these}) to complete it into an
\t{NP}. Thus all the test cases contain both singular and plural
variants, and by linearizing these 4 trees, we get the 8 strings shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:adjAttr}.

\label{fig:treesWithHoles}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Context} 

Now that we have a set of test cases, we create contexts that show all variation within them.
By \emph{context}, we mean simply a tree in some other category, with a \emph{hole} of type \t{CN}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:treesWithHoles}.
In this grammar, the only category above is \t{NP}, and there is only one way that a \t{CN} can end up in an \t{NP}: by using the function \t{DetCN : Det $\rightarrow$ CN $\rightarrow$ NP}.

Just like before, we start by creating a representative and minimal set of arguments of type \t{Det}. So far the relevant features have been grammatical gender an adjective placement---we have 4 trees with all combinations of \{masculine, feminine\} and \{pre,post\}. The resulting trees have \emph{variable} number, but now we have a category \t{Det} with an inherent number, so we can create the context that picks the string ``casa  peque\~{n}a'', and another that picks ``casas  peque\~{n}as''. By simple combinatorics, we pick the representative set of \t{Det} with one singular and one plural element, e.g. \t{this} and \t{these}, and form two contexts: \verb|DetCN this _| and  \verb|DetCN these _|. We plug in the 4 test cases, and get 8 trees in total: \t{\{DetCN this (good house), \dots, DetCN these (small hill)\}}.


The grammar, with only 12-word lexicon and 5 syntactic functions, generates \todo{n} trees up to depth 5\footnote{example of a tree of that depth}. These 8 test cases are enough to test whether the syntactic function \t{AdjCN} is correctly implemented.  

Of course, this test set will not catch if e.g. any of the lexical functions contains a typo, or if there is a more severe bug in the morphological paradigms. But there are easier methods to test for such bugs---our goal is to test the more abstract, syntactic phenomena with as few trees as possible.
%a bug in the morphological paradigms will go unnoticed, 


\paragraph{Pruning}

For the previous example, we did not need any pruning: the cross product of all relevant distinctions produced a minimal and representative set of trees. Now assume we have a larger grammar, which also covers adjectives in a predicative position: e.g. \emph{esta casa es peque\~{n}a} `this house is small' and \emph{esta casa es buena} `this house is good'. The distinction which made us choose \t{small} and \t{good} in the first place is now gone: in predicative position, both adjectives behave the same. Thus, in this larger grammar, when we want to test adjectives, it is necessary to include two examples when in attributive position, but only one when in predicative position. We describe exactly how this works in Section~\ref{sec:details}.
%In total we would get 12 sentences: the 8 shown previously, and 4 

\subsection{Examples of real bugs} 
To make this more concrete, we list out some examples of bugs found in real grammars, and how they would be found by this generation.

\paragraph{Preposition contraction in Dutch} Some prepositions should merge with a single determiner or pronoun, e.g. \emph{met~deze} `with this' becomes \emph{hiermee} `herewith', but stay independent when the determiner quantifies a noun, e.g. \emph{met deze huis} `with this house'. When testing \t{PrepNP}, the program should generate one preposition that contracts and one that does not, as well as one \t{NP} that is a single determiner, and one that comes from a noun. 
In order to catch a bug in the function, or confirm there is none, the program should generate the four trees
\t{PrepNP} \{ \stackanchor{\tt with}{\tt without} \} \{ \stackanchor{\tt DetNP this}{\tt DetCN this house} \}. 

\paragraph{Determiner placement in Basque} When a number or a possessive pronoun acts as a determiner in a complex noun phrase, it is placed
between ``heavy'' modifiers, such as adverbials or relative clauses, and the rest of the noun phrase. Demonstrative pronouns, such as \emph{this},
 are placed before all modifiers. Indefinite article goes at the end of the whole noun phrase as an independent word.
If there is a ``light'' modifier, such as an adjective, the definite article is suffixed to the modifier; otherwise it is suffixed to the noun.
In order to test the implementation of this phenomenon, we need a subset of the following trees: \\
\{ \stackanchor{ \tt AdvNP on\_the\_hill}{ $\varnothing$ }  \}  (\t{DetCN} \{ \stackanchor{\stackanchor{\tts{a}}{\tts{the}}}{\stackanchor{\tts{this}}{\tts{your}}} \} \{ \stackanchor{\tt AdjCN small}{$\varnothing$} \} {\tt house})





\section{Technical details}
\label{sec:details}

GF grammar compiles into a low-level format called PGF. After the
compilation, we get one category for each combination of parameters:
for English adjectives, \texttt{A => A$_{pos}$, A$_{comp}$,
A$_{superl}$}, and for Spanish, \texttt{A => A$_{pos×sg×masc}$, \dots,
A$_{superl×pl×fem}$}. 

Suddenly, we have a bunch of new types, and those are different for
each concrete syntax! The original question ``we need a sample of
nouns/verbs/… that makes sense'' can be simplified ``we need one
noun/verb/… of each type''. The types are determined by the parameters
in the concrete syntax. 

So remember all the hassle when you can't pattern match strings to
know something, but instead you have to define a parameter? This is
actually a nice side effect from that: each parameter contributes to a
new category, so it pays off in generating examples. If the feature is
important for your grammar---say that in language A, negation is
simply attaching the word  ``no'' before the verb, and in language B,
negation changes the word order and the object case. Then in the GF
grammar for language B, we would need a Boolean \texttt{isNeg} field
in the relevant categories, which we then pattern match against in
order to determine the relevant operations. That parameter in the
abstract category translates into different concrete categories, and
that way, when we generate example trees, we make sure to include one
of each. For instance, in language A, we could end up with the trees
``any horse'' and ``all horses'' when testing NPs, but in language B,
the set would also include ``no horses''. 



\section{Evaluation}


\begin{itemize}
\item Cost
  \begin{itemize}
  \item time of generating examples
  \item time of looking at examples
  \end{itemize}

\item Effect
  \begin{itemize}
  \item compare against other methods -- what methods?
  \item For application grammars, if you're writing them from scratch, it is actually pretty feasible to just gt the hell out of it as you write. But this doesn't work for bigger grammars.
  \item Morphology can be tested efficiently againts any existing morphological analyser. I've used Apertium for Dutch and Basque.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Future work}


Generality -- turn any other grammar formalism into PGF, and you can use this method to test it.


We plan to look into existing text corpora, and find trees that are
structurally identical  to those that our program generates as a
minimal and representative example. As a simplified example, ``a worm
without winter'', generated by the program, would be identical\footnote{This particular example holds for English, but in another language, the words ``pizza'' and ``worm'', as well as ``winter'' and ``cheese'' may not match in all relevant features---grammatical gender, whether the word starts with a vowel or a consonant, etc. All this information comes from the concrete syntax!} 
in structure to ``a pizza without cheese'', found in a real text, and
can thus be substituted for the generated one.   
Alternatively, we could use statistical information on co-occurrences
of words, and generate appropriate pools of words, from which we draw
example sentences.
